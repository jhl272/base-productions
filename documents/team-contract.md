# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name. Plus full name and NetID of each of your team members.

Joseph Lee - jhl272
Catherine Yoo - sy597
Elise Berg - emb385
Rachel Harkins - reh279

2. To what goals do we all commit?

We all get our own page, and two people team up and work on a separate interactivity page (ex: form and photo gallery)

3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

Get your work done before the deadline
Meet at least once a week before each Milestone
Let us know beforehand if you cannot make it to a meeting


4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

Group chat on GroupMe
Respond within 2 hours
Update the group chat once you have done something
Meet at least once a week


5. How will we communicate and work with our client?

Face to face meetings or phone calls before each milestone


6. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

Each person will get ownership of one webpage (will update on what later on)

Catherine - timekeeper
Elise - client interaction
Rachel - ensuring we meet target audience
Joseph - code editor (make it look nice), facilitator


7. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

We will update on what we have contributed each time to the group chat
What we will say to team members:
“Hey, I know you are busy and have other things to do, but since this is a group project, it is only fair to be equally contributing. If you continue to not contribute, it will only affect you as we receive individual grades for this project, so you will get graded on as much as you contribute”


8. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

Let them know that we receive individual grades for this project so you will get graded on as much as you contribute

9. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

We will listen to everyone’s suggestion, whether in person during the meeting or over the groupchat.
Decide on majority consensus


10. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

We will have coffee and pastries at every in person meeting.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
